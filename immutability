Immutable means Unchangeable

Ummutability concept is used for String objects i.e String objects are immutable.
it means once String object is created;its data or state cannot be changed but a new string is created

String objects are immutable in java and therefore if a password is stored as plain text
it will be available in memory until garbage collector clears it, but
string object are stored in string constant pool for re-usability and garbage
collection is not applicable in scp,while is a security threat.
with an array, you can explicit wipe the data after you re done with it
you can overwrite the array with anything you like and the password wont be present anywhere in the system
even before garbage collection
