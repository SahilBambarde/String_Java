StringBuffer -> mutable , synchronized, low performance

StringBuilder -> 1.5 JDK
Non Synchronized
Same as StringBuffer methods and constructors
mutable objects

Difference between String , StringBuffer and StringBuilder

String                              StringBuffer                                StringBuilder
Heap                             Heap                                          Heap

Immutable                           mutable                                     mutable

if we change the value             less memory                                  less memory
of String a lot of time, it
will allocate more memory


Not ThreadSafe                      ThreadSafe                                      Not ThreadSafe


Slow                                Fast                                            Fast

Use: if data is not changing        if data is changing                           if data is changing
frequently                          freq                                                freq
