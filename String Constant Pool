String contact pool in Heap Area

String s1 = new String("Sahil"); (SCP)(Heap)
String s1 = "Mrunmai" (SCP)

the String objects present in SCP are not applicable for garbage collection because
a reference variable internally is maintained by jvm

---------------------------------------

String s1 = new String("deepak") (SCP)(HEAP)
String s2 = new String("Sahil") (SCP)(HEAP)
String s3 = new String("deepak") (HEAP)
String s4 = "amit" (SCP) //1 object created
String s5 = "deepak"
String s5 ="deepak"  refer to SCP
